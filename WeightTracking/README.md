Project Summary
The Weight-Tracking App was developed to address the needs of users who want to monitor their daily weight, set weight goals, and stay motivated throughout their weight management journey. The app allows users to log in, create accounts, add weight entries, set goals, and receive notifications when goals are achieved. It is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience while ensuring data persistence and security.
User Needs Addressed
The primary user needs addressed by this app include:
•	Daily weight tracking
•	Goal setting for weight management
•	User authentication for personalized experiences
•	Notifications for motivation and goal achievement
Screens and Features
To support these needs, the app includes the following screens and features:
•	Login and Registration Screen: This screen allows users to log in or create a new account. It includes fields for username, email, password, and registration details for new users.
•	Home Screen: This screen displays a grid of daily weights and dates, providing an overview of the user's weight tracking history.
•	Add Weight Screen: This screen includes fields for entering weight and selecting a date, allowing users to log their daily weight.
•	Set Goal Screen: This screen allows users to set or update their weight goals, with fields for entering the goal weight.
•	Notification System: Sends alerts to users when they reach their goal weight or need motivation.
•	Theme Toggle Button: Allows users to switch between day and night modes for better visual comfort.
UI Design Considerations
The UI design was focused on providing a user-centered experience. Its designs were kept simple and intuitive, ensuring that users could easily navigate the app and perform necessary actions without confusion. Clear labels, buttons, and feedback messages ensured that the app was user-friendly. Including a theme toggle button allowed users to customize their experience based on their preferences for light or dark mode.
Coding Approach
The coding process involved careful planning and modular development. Key strategies included:
•	Modular Code Design: Breaking down the app's functionality into separate, manageable components.
•	Database Integration: SQLite is used for data persistence to ensure user data is stored securely and efficiently retrieved.
•	User Authentication: Implementing secure login and registration processes to protect user data.
•	Testing and Iteration: Continuously testing the app using the Android Emulator to identify and fix bugs and ensure the app's functionality.
These techniques ensured the app was developed systematically, with each component tested and refined before moving on to the next.
Testing and Debugging
Testing was a critical part of the development process. The app was tested extensively using the Android Emulator to ensure all features worked as intended. This process revealed several issues, such as incorrect user inputs and UI elements not behaving as expected, which were then addressed. Testing helped ensure the app's reliability and usability.
Challenges and Innovations
One of the main challenges was ensuring data persistence and user authentication, and innovating with SQLite database integration allowed for secure storage and retrieval of user data. additionally, implementing the theme toggle feature required carefully handling UI states and ensuring a consistent user experience across different modes.
Success and Demonstration of Skills
The app's most successful component was the user authentication and data management system. This component demonstrated my ability to integrate back-end functionality with front-end design, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. Implementing the notification system and theme toggle button also highlighted my skills in enhancing user engagement and customization.
