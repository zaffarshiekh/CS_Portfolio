**Project Overview:**

The DriverPass project was for a client seeking a system to train individuals to pass their driving tests. They needed a digital solution for online learning and scheduling driving lessons, complete with user-friendly interfaces and robust back-end support to handle diverse user interactions and secure payment processing.

**Reflecting on Skills and Project Work:**

**•	Briefly summarize the project, the client, and their needs.** DriverPass, our client, needed a system that supports online learning and practical driving instruction. They wanted a platform that could schedule lessons, process payments securely, and adapt to changing DMV requirements.
**•	What did you do well?** I excelled at designing intuitive user flows, ensuring that each step, from login to lesson scheduling, was clear and simple. I also took pride in creating secure processes for user information and payments.
**•	If revising any part of the work, what would it be?** I'd revisit the initial design phase, specifically the use case diagrams. With hindsight, adding more detail to these could have provided an even clearer roadmap for development.
**•	How did you interpret user needs into the system design?** I listened closely to the client's goals and imagined myself as an end-user to integrate their needs into our design. User-centric design is crucial—it ensures the system is practical, enjoyable, and meets real-world needs.
**•	Approach to designing software and future strategies?** My approach is systematic yet flexible, starting with thorough research and user story mapping. In the future, I'd incorporate user feedback earlier in the design process to fine-tune the system to their needs.
