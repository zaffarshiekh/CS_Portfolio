**SNHU - CS: Programming Languages**
## Project Summary:
This project develops an item-tracking program for The Corner Grocer to analyze purchase records, helping the store rearrange its produce section based on the purchase frequency of items. The program provides a console-based interface that allows users to check the frequency of specific items, print out a frequency list of all things, display a histogram of item frequencies, and exit the program.

## **Reflection:**
### **Project Accomplishments:**
- I am particularly proud of implementing the `ItemTracker` class. It encapsulates all the functionalities required for the item-tracking system and provides a clean, easy-to-use interface to the rest of the program.

### **Areas for Enhancement:**
- The code could be enhanced by adding more robust error handling, such as checking for file format correctness and handling unexpected user inputs more gracefully.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) could make the program more user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users.
- Optimization of data structures and algorithms used could improve the efficiency, significantly when scaling up to handle a large number of items.

### **Challenges Overcome:**
- The most challenging aspect was ensuring accurate reading and writing of data from and to files. I overcame this by thoroughly researching file I/O operations in C++ and implementing careful checks before performing any file operations.
- I've added extensive commenting and followed consistent naming conventions, which will be a valuable reference for future projects.

### **Transferable Skills:**
- The skills in implementing classes, managing file I/O, and ensuring input validation are highly transferable to future projects that require data management and user interaction.
- The practice of writing clean commented, and well-structured code will benefit all future software development projects.

### **Code Maintainability:**
- To ensure maintainability, I used clear naming conventions and included comprehensive comments explaining the functionality of each part of the code.
- By structuring the code modularity, I've made it adaptable for future extensions, such as adding new features or integrating with other systems.

## **How to Use:**
To use the item-tracking system, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler, ensuring all required header files are included.
3. Run the compiled executable and interact with the program through the console menu.
