# Agile Methodologies in Software Development â€“ SNHU Travel Project

# Project Overview:

This repository contains two critical components of my work on the SNHU Travel project at ChadaTech, showcasing the application of Agile methodologies in software development. The project demonstrates a transition from traditional Waterfall methodologies to Agile, specifically focusing on the Scrum framework.
Contents:

# 1. PowerPoint Presentation:
- Title: "Sprint Review Retrospective"
- Description: A comprehensive presentation prepared for ChadaTech leadership, outlining the key aspects of the Scrum-Agile approach. It contrasts Agile with the Waterfall methodology, discusses various roles in a Scrum team, explains the Agile SDLC phases, and considers factors for choosing between Agile and Waterfall. The presentation also includes a case study of the SNHU Travel project, illustrating Agile in action.

# 2.	Sprint Review and Retrospective Report:
- Title: "Sprint Review and Retrospective"
- Description: This document is a detailed report reflecting the Scrum Agile approach's application in the SNHU Travel project. It includes insights on the execution of Scrum events, the importance of communication in Agile environments, the collaboration between different roles (Product Owner, Developer, Tester), and user stories in product development.

Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them:
This project demonstrates how to interpret user needs effectively by creating user stories that transform complex requirements into actionable and understandable tasks, aligning development with user expectations.

Agile Development Approach:
The approach to program development is heavily influenced by Agile methodologies, aiming to incorporate iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptive planning in future projects.

Being a Good Team Member:
The project underscores the importance of collaboration, open communication, and flexibility, essential qualities for being an influential team member in software development.

# Objectives:
