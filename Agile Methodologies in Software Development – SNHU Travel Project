Project Overview

This repository contains two key components of my work on the SNHU Travel project at ChadaTech, showcasing the application of Agile methodologies in software development. The project demonstrates a transition from traditional Waterfall methodologies to Agile, specifically focusing on the Scrum framework.
Contents:
1.	PowerPoint Presentation:
•	Title: "Transitioning to Agile: A Comparative Analysis"
•	Description: A comprehensive presentation prepared for ChadaTech leadership, outlining the key aspects of the Scrum-Agile approach. It contrasts Agile with the Waterfall methodology, discusses various roles in a Scrum team, explains the Agile SDLC phases, and considers factors for choosing between Agile and Waterfall. The presentation also includes a case study of the SNHU Travel project, illustrating Agile in action.
